Wasm-4 game jam entry.

Explore the space at your own leisure. If you'd like, you can find and land on a specific 
planet. The bottom line shows the distance to that planet, you probably 
would need to fly around a bit to find where it is. 


Arrows to move the ship (it changes the shape depending on its speed)


If you get stuck in a planets gravity well, use booster packs with X or SPACEBAR.


To use auto-stabilizers press  Z, but notice that  their power is limited and they wouldn't help in a strong gravity field.


You can shoot particles with the left mouse click, but they don't do anything, this is a pieceful game.
